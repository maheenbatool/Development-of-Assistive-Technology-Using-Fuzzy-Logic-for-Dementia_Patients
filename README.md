# Development-of-Assistive-Technology-Using-Fuzzy-Logic-for-a-Person-with-Dementia
This thesis introduces a technique to use fuzzy logic to identify the stage of dementia patients by 
analyzing the extent of the person’s recognition and what they recognize better. The main 
contribution is Mamdani fuzzy inference systems using the fuzzy logic toolbox. Fuzzy theories are 
becoming very useful in current medical research. This project is focused on decision making using 
some defined set rules to study every patient independently as every patient has a different 
experience with dementia, it can help medical researchers and can help medical professionals in reorganizing the patient’s life better


This project aims to use fuzzy logic to help people with dementia by analyzing the extent of the 
person’s recognition and what they recognize better. Fuzzy Inference system has been used to 
explore a technique for medical diagnosis to identify the extent of a patient’s recognition level. The 
proposed system is useful for the decision-making approach of the dementia stage. It also considers 
the relevant time of each stage which gives more precise results and better classification of patient’s 
dementia stage. 
The main objective of this project is to use the images in pieces and check the extent of recognition 
from one piece to when all the pieces of an image are gathered. This project is focused on decision 
making using some defined set rules to study every patient independently as every patient has a 
different experience with dementia, it can help medical researchers and can help medical 
professionals in re-organizing the patient’s life better. The recognition level of the patient also 
depends on the complexity of the image, which can have different levels from least complex to most 
complex images. 
A person suffering from dementia can also have different recognition levels for different objects and 
places, for example recognizing a family member would be faster and easier than recognizing a 
house. The Fuzzy based decision-making system takes into account all three possibilities and outputs 
are designed based on input variables to decide the most accurate outcome. 


We present a decision-making algorithm that uses Mamdani fuzzy inference system, it is a rule-based 
description of a system. Using these rules decides the output of the system to obtain the dementia 
patient’s memory level. These rules work on any input image that is fed into the system, which will 
be different for every patient. When an image is fed into the system, these descriptive rules then 
check which rule is applicable to the input so the best suitable outcome occurs.
